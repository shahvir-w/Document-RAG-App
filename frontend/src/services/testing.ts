This document discusses a meta-analysis published in the Iranian Journal of Public Health, which evaluates the efficacy and side effects of two antiepileptic drugs: levetiracetam (LEV) and carbamazepine (CBZ). The study aims to provide a comparative analysis of these medications in the treatment of epilepsy, a neurological disorder affecting around 70 million people worldwide.

# Background on Epilepsy
- **Prevalence**: Epilepsy is a widespread neurological condition with varying incidence rates across different economic regions. Approximately 85% of patients do not receive adequate treatment, despite many having manageable forms of the disorder.

# Drugs Compared
## Levetiracetam (LEV)
A newer antiepileptic drug recognized for its broad-spectrum efficacy and favorable safety profile.
## Carbamazepine (CBZ)
A traditional antiepileptic medication that is widely used but has a narrower therapeutic index and is prone to significant drug interactions.

# Study Design
- The authors conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LEV and CBZ, focusing on outcomes such as seizure-free intervals, withdrawal rates due to adverse events, and various side effects.

# Methodology
- The literature search included databases like PubMed and EMBASE, with studies selected based on specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by two independent authors.

# Results
- **Study Inclusion**: Three RCTs were included, involving 1,696 patients. The analysis indicated similar rates of seizure freedom between LEV and CBZ. However, LEV was associated with a higher incidence of depression, while CBZ was linked to more frequent rashes.
- **Adverse Events**: The study assessed various adverse events, including headache, fatigue, and gastrointestinal issues, with mixed results regarding their occurrence between the two drugs.

# Limitations
- The authors acknowledged that the limited number of studies and patients may affect the reliability of the results. They also pointed out challenges in assessing psychological and psychiatric adverse effects due to their subjective nature.

# Conclusion
- The meta-analysis suggests that both LEV and CBZ are effective in managing epilepsy, but they differ in their side effect profiles. The authors advocate for more extensive studies to provide clearer insights into the comparative efficacy and safety of these medications.

# Keywords
- Efficacy, Levetiracetam, Carbamazepine, Epilepsy, Meta-analysis.

# Study Inclusion and Methodology
- The initial search yielded 174 articles, with 35 reviewed in detail, leading to the inclusion of 3 RCTs involving 1,696 patients. Meta-regression was not performed due to the small number of studies, which could introduce bias.

# Study Characteristics
- The included studies were published between 2007 and 2013 and conducted in various countries, focusing on adult patients with sample sizes ranging from 128 to 996 and a follow-up duration of 12 months.

# Quality Assessment
- The quality of the RCTs was evaluated using the Jadad scale, indicating that the studies were of high quality.

# Outcomes
- **Seizure Freedom**: No significant difference was found between LEV and CBZ regarding seizure freedom at both 6 months and 12 months.
- **Discontinuation Due to Adverse Events (AEs)**: LEV had a significantly lower rate of discontinuation due to AEs compared to CBZ.
- **Adverse Events**: No significant differences were found in the frequency of several AEs (headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and vertigo) between the two drugs. However, LEV was associated with a higher incidence of depression and a lower incidence of rash compared to CBZ.

# Statistical Analysis
- The results included pooled risk ratios (RR) with confidence intervals (CI) to assess the efficacy and safety of the treatments, indicating that while LEV showed some advantages in tolerability, there was no significant difference in seizure control.

# Adverse Events Analysis
- The analysis summarized results for specific adverse events with statistical measures, including risk ratios (RR) and confidence intervals (CI). The I-squared values indicated low to moderate heterogeneity among studies.

# Findings
- LEV showed a tendency to reduce treatment withdrawal due to AEs compared to CBZ, although no statistically significant differences were found in seizure freedom rates. LEV was associated with a higher incidence of depression, while CBZ was linked to a higher rate of rash.

# Limitations
- The small number of studies and patients included limits the robustness of the conclusions. There is also a lack of standardized criteria for reporting AEs, making comparisons challenging.

# Conclusion
- Major outcomes regarding seizure freedom were similar for both LEV and CBZ, but the differing side effect profiles may influence treatment choices based on patient preferences. Further research is needed to clarify the relationship between LEV and depression and to establish standardized measures for reporting AEs.

# Ethical Considerations
- The authors declare adherence to ethical standards, including issues related to consent and data integrity.

# References Overview
- The text includes references from various studies evaluating the efficacy, safety, and side effects of LEV and CBZ in treating epilepsy, emphasizing ongoing evaluations of their clinical use.

Perampanel (PER), a third-generation ASM, showed to improve nocturnal sleep in patients with epilepsy (PWE). Although ASMs can have beneficial effects on nocturnal sleep and daytime sleepiness, no study investigated the effect of PER on both sleep–wake cycle and daytime sleepiness. Therefore, this study aimed to objectively evaluate the sleep–wake cycle and daytime sleepiness in PWE treated with PER as adjunctive therapy. Methods This prospectiv e study included adult PWE who received PER as add-on treatment. Sleep–wake cycle was assessed through actigraphic monitoring and daytime sleepiness by the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) performed at the end of the actigraphic recording. All patients performed both tests at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Results Ten patients (mean ag e: 44.50 ± 22.71 y ears, 50.0% female) were included. The mean monthly seizure frequency was 3.20 ± 5. 94. Six of ten patients started PER as a first add-on treatment. The final PER dose was 5.11 ± 2. 02 mg/day, and nine of ten patients achieved seizure freedom at follow-up. There was a significant decrease in mean monthly seizure frequency from baseline to follow-up (p = 0.004). N o significant changes were found in the sleep–wake cycle parameters. An increase in sleep latency mean was observed at MSLT at 6-month follow-up (p = 0.005). C onclusions This study confir ms that adjunctive PER is effective on seizures without pathologically change of the sleep–wake cycle in PWE and can even improve daytime sleepiness. This effect can be mediated by the achievement of seizure control. Therefore, PER may be promising in PWE with sleep disturbances and daytime sleepiness. Keywords Epileptic seizur es · Anti-seizure medication · Sleep–wake · Somnolence · Actigraphy · Multiple sleep latency test Introduction The bidirectional relation between sleep and epilepsy is well established since disturbed sleep and sleep deprivation can trigger epileptic seizures, but also these latter can disrupt sleep [1]. Antiseizure medications (ASMs) used for treating epileptic seizures may also affect nocturnal sleep and daytime vigilance of patients with epilepsy (PWE). Specifically, ASMs may have a potential positive or negative impact on sleep architecture measured through polysomnography, on subjective sleep quality measured by questionnaires, as well as on daytime somnolence evaluated with the multiple wakefulness test (MWT) or multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) [2–4]. Recent studies have suggested that third-generation ASMs may have more beneficial effects on the sleep–wake cycle than the older ones [2–5]. Perampanel (PER) is a third- generation ASM and shows a significant beneficial effect on epileptic seizures since it acts on the modulation of glutamatergic post-synaptic transmission via non-competitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5 methyl-4 isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) antagonism [6]. PER is approved as add-on treatment in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, and its efficacy and tolerability have been widely documented, also when used as a first add-on treatment [7–12]. Among the newest ASMs, PER * Claudio Liguori do tt.claudioliguori@yahoo.it 1 Department of Systems Medicine, University of Rome “Tor V ergata”, Rome, Italy 2 Sleep Medicine Centre, N eurology Unit, University Hospital of “Tor Vergata”, Rome, Italy 3 Epilepsy Centre, Sleep Medicine Centr e, Neurology Unit, Neurology Unit, Department of Systems Medicine, University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Viale Oxford 81, 00133 Rome, Italy 4 IRCCS Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy / Published online: 8 December 2022 Neurological Sciences (2023) 44:1361–1368 1 3 presents with a good profile on nocturnal sleep, measured by both polysomnography and validated questionnaires [13–16]. The mechanism of action of the drug can also explain its effect on sleep disorders, such as restless legs syndrome [17] or insomnia [18], thus reinforcing the clinical observation of its benefits on sleep in PWE. Considering that the most common adverse event of PER is daytime somnolence [19, 20], few reports tested the effects of PER on daytime vigilance and sleepiness, assessing these symptoms more through the use of subjective questionnaires than with objective tests [14–16]. Recent evidence described the dysregulation of the sleep–wake cycle in PWE [21], which can support both sleep impairment and daytime sleepiness of PWE. Actigraphy is a widely approved instrument to objectively monitor the sleep–wake cycle over a long period (from 1 week to 1 month, in general). Moreover, MSLT is recognized as the best instrument to monitor daytime sleep propensity and can help identifying central disorders of hypersomnolence. Therefore, in this study, the effect of PER on the sleep–wake cycle and daytime sleepiness was evaluated. In particular, objective instruments such as actigraphy and MSLT were performed in PWE at baseline and after 6 months of treatment by PER, which was used according to clinical practice and indication in PWE who showed persistent epileptic seizures although the prescription of an adequate ASM monotherapy or polytherapy. Materials and methods Participants and study design PWE who started PER as an add-on treatment for better controlling their epileptic seizures were observed in this study. PER was prescribed and titrated in all patients accord- ing to clinical practice and guidelines at our epilepsy cen- tre. Briefly, the initial titration of PER was 2 mg daily for 2 weeks, then followed by the increment to 4 to 10 mg daily until the follow-up visit [11]. Epileptic seizures and epilep- tic syndromes were classified according to the classification proposed by the International League Against Epilepsy — ILAE [22]. Eligibility criteria for the inclusion of patients in this study were (1) age ≥ 18  years old and (2) starting PER as adjunctive therapy for controlling epileptic seizures accord- ing to the regulatory approved indications. Exclusion criteria included (1) pregnancy or planned pregnancy, (2) planned surgery or surgery performed in the 2 months preceding the sleep studies, (3) history of suicide attempts, (4) his- tory of drug or alcohol abuse, (5) diagnosis of neurologic or psychiatric disorders other than epilepsy, (6) shift work or jet lag, (7) sleep disorders (e.g. obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, restless leg syndrome) evaluated by a detailed medical interview and sleep medicine consultation, (8) ingestion of alcohol or caffeine on the day of the MSLT, and (9) occurrence of seizures during the 7-day actigraphic monitoring and in the 24-h before MSLT and checked by using the epilepsy diary. Specifically, subjects and/or their relatives were instructed to fill in a seizure log in order to obtain the baseline and follow-up seizure frequency. They were also instructed on the use of sleep logs and seizure dia- ries, which were filled in for the entire duration of the study. At baseline, all patients underwent a clinical and neuro- logical visit, including a sleep medicine interview, followed by a 7-day actigraphic recording coupled with sleep and sei- zure diaries, and in the morning after the last night of acti- graphic recording a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed. At the end of these investigations, all patients started PER treatment (T0) and underwent a follow-up visit after 6 months of treatment (T1), according to the common clinical practice at our centre. At the follow-up visit, patients repeated the clinical and neurological visit, the 7-day acti- graphic recording coupled with sleep and seizure diaries, and the MSLT. For this study, the following data were collected from the clinical records of patients: adverse events, reten- tion rate, PER dose, and monthly seizure frequency. The response rate for epilepsy was then evaluated as a reduction of ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 75% than baseline (monthly evalu- ated before starting PER), or seizure freedom. The study protocol was considered observational accord- ing to the STROBE statement by the internal review board of our institutional Ethical Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants in the study. Actigraphic recording Actigraphy (Actiwatch2, Philips Respironics) was performed as previously described following the local guidelines of the sleep medicine centre owing to the same Neurology Unit [23, 24]. All patients started the monitoring at the end of the baseline visit before starting PER treatment and repeated it after the 6-month follow-up visit. Actigraphs were worn on participants’ non-dominant wrist to gather activity and light exposure data for 7 consecutive days. Patients were instructed to push the button on the side of the watch at bedtime and wake time, as well as to follow their daily living routines. Patients also filled out a sleep diary before they went to bed each night and as soon as they woke in the morning. Sleep and wake characteristics were separately monitored, and non-parametric circadian rhythm activity (NPCRA) was analysed with CamNTech MotionWare 1.2.26 by sleep medicine experts (CL, FI, FP) [23, 24]. The actigraphic parameters analysed were (see Table 1): time in bed (TIB), total elapsed time between the “lights off” and “got up” times; assumed sleep time (AST), sleep time excluding sleep latency; 1362 Neurological Sciences (2023) 44:1361–1368 1 3 total sleep time (TST), total time spent in sleep according to the epoch-by-epoch wake/sleep categorization excluding sleep latency and wake periods between “fell asleep” and “got up” times; sleep efficiency (SE), defined as the ratio between TST and TIB; sleep latency (SL), the time between “lights off” and “fell asleep”; central phase measure (CPM), the midpoint between “fell asleep” and “wake up,” expressed as the number of minutes past midnight; actual wake time (AWT), defined as the duration expressed in minutes of “wake periods” between “fell asleep” and “got up” times; total activity score (TAS), defined as the total of all the activity counts during the AST ; fragmentation index (FI) defined as the sum of the “mobile time (%)” and the “immobile bouts < = 1  min (%)” and is an indicator of the degree of fragmentation of the sleep period; day/night activity ratio, expressed as daytime activity average/ night time activity average. Regarding NPCRA, the following parameters were analysed: inter-daily stability (IS), quantifying the degree of regularity in the activity-rest pattern, with higher values corresponding to higher synchronisation; intra-daily variability (IV), quantifying the degree of fragmentation of activity rest periods, with higher values representing a very fragmented rest-activity rhythm; least 5 (L5) average activity, providing the average activity level for the sequence of the lowest five active hours; most 10 (M10) average activity, providing the average activity level for the sequence of the highest ten active hours; relative amplitude (RA), calculated by using  the L5 to M10 measures  and representing the synchronization with the average 24-h cycle, where higher values represent a better synchronized rest-activity rhythm [25, 26]. These parameters were obtained through the traditional analysis of circadian rhythms that fits physiological indicators to a Cosine waveform shape (Cosinor analysis) [27]. Multiple sleep latency test The multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed to objectively test daytime sleepiness. The test started the morning after the last night of actigraphic recording. Before starting the test, clinical researchers (CL, FP, FI) monitored that patient slept as usual during the actigraphic record- ing and showed a TST of the last night recorded longer than 6 h. Although polysomnography was not performed to confirm the total sleep time, researchers (CL, FI, FP) checked for the sleep habits of PWE also considering the sleep diaries. MSLT consisted of four trials performed at 2-h intervals and started 2 h after awakening [28, 29]. Day- time sleep measures were calculated for each participant, and the following parameters were collected: mean sleep latency (MSL) calculated as the average of the sleep latency in each trial of the MSLT; the number of sleep-onset REM Table 1 Descr iption of actigraphic measure considered in the present study Variable Definition Abbreviation Quantitative actigraphic measures   Time in bed Time, in minutes, from bedtime to wake up timeTIB   Assumed sleep timeTime in bed after sleep latency AST   Total sleep timeSum of all epochs scored as sleep between sleep onset and wake up time, excluding sleep latency and wake periods TST   Sleep latency Interval, in minutes, between bedtime and sleep onsetSL   Sleep efficiencyTotal sleep time divided by time in bed multiplied by 100SE   Actual wake timeSum, in minutes, of all epochs scored as wake between “fell asleep” and “got up” timesAWT   Centr al phase measureMidpoint between “fell asleep” and “wake up,” expressed as number of minutes past midnight CPM   Total activity scoreSum of all activity counts during the assumed sleep periodTAS   Fragmentation indexNumber of epochs with movement divided by TST duration plus number of consecutive epochs of immobility divided by the total number of immobility epochs multiplied by 100 FI   Day/night activity ratio Daytime activity average/night time activity average Nonparametric actigraphic measures   Interdaily stabilityRatio of activity level variance within each 24-h pattern to the overall activity level vari- ance IS   Intradaily variabilityRatio of the mean squares of the difference between consecutive hours and the mean squares around the overall mean IV   M10 Average amplitudes of the most active 10-h periodM10   L5 Average amplitudes of the least active 5-h periodL5   Relative amplitudeRatio of the most active 10-h period minus the least active 5-h period to the most active 10-h period plus the least active 5-h period RA 1363Neurological Sciences (2023) 44:1361–1368 1 3 periods (SOREMPs), considered as the emergence of REM sleep during the sleep period in each session of the MSLT. According to the American Association of Sleep Medicine, a MSL of < 8  min was considered diagnostic of pathological sleepiness [30]. Statistical analysis The statistical analysis was performed using commercial software SPSS version 25 [31]. The description of demo- graphic and clinical data were reported as mean ± s tandard deviation or as counts and percentages. Response to treat- ment was described as absolute and relative frequencies. First, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to check the normal distribution of the data. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess changes in clinical, MSLT, and acti- graphic data between baseline and 6-month follow-up, and data were reported as medians and ranges. Effect sizes were calculated by Cohen’s d, and the magnitude of the effects was interpreted with the following intervals: 0.1 to 0.3 small effect; 0.3 to 0.5 intermediate effect; 0.5 and higher strong effect. Results Ten patients with epilepsy (50.0% female), with a mean age of 44.50 ± 22.71  years old were included in the study. The mean illness duration was 14.20 ± 13.21  years. The majority of patients (n = 6 ; 60%) started PER as a first add-on treatment, while 20% (n = 2) s tarted as a second and the other 20% (n = 2) as a third add-on therapy. The PER daily dose at follow-up was 5.11 ± 2 .02 mg/day, and seizure freedom was achieved by 90% of patients. No adverse events and no drop-out were registered between baseline and follow-up. There was a significant decrease in median monthly seizure frequency from baseline (Md = 1.0) t o 6-month follow-up (Md = 0) ( p = 0.004, d = 4.713). The patient ’s demographic and clinical features at baseline and at 6-month follow-up are presented in Table 2 . Considering sleep–wake cycle data, as presented in Table 3, no significant changes were found from baseline to the 6-month follow-up in any of the sleep–wake and NPCRA parameters measured through actigraphy. At baseline, 1 patient showed pathological sleepiness (MSL = 7.125  min) and 2 had “borderline” values (both MSL = 8.50  min), while at the 6-month follow-up all patients showed normal MSL values. Consistently, a significant increase in the MSL at MSLT trials was observed at the 6-month follow-up (T0 Md = 12.81; T1 Md = 19.25; p = 0.005, d = 3.842). No SOREMPs were measured at baseline and follow-up in all patients. In Table 4, descriptions of MSLT data for each patient at baseline and follow-up were reported. Discussion PER demonstrated its effectiveness and tolerability in PWE in real-world studies since reduced the frequency of epileptic seizures and also improves the burden of epilepsy-related comorbidities [7–12, 32]. Among all of the comorbidities, nocturnal sleep impairment and daytime sleepiness represent frequent complaints of PWE. Considering that ASMs can impact nocturnal sleep and daytime vigilance in PWE and that daytime somnolence is a common adverse event associated with PER, this study aimed to assess Table 2 P atients’ demographic and clinical features at baseline and at 6-month follow-up Continuous data are presented as mean ± s tandard deviation Abbreviations: ASM, antiseizure medication; FU, follow-up; CBZ, Carbamazepine; LEV, Levetiracetam; LCM, Lacosamide; PHB, phe- nobarbital; VPA, valproic Acid; ZNS, Zonisamide * Significant c hanges between baseline and follow-up (p = 0.004) Total (n = 10) F emale, n (%) 5(50.0) Mean age 44.50 ± 22.71 Epilepsy mean duration in years14.20 ± 13.21 Etiology, n (%)   Genetic   Structural   Unknown 1 (10.0) 3 (30.0) 6 (60.0) Seizure type, n (%)   Generalized   Focal and Generalized 3 (30.0) 7 (70.0) Lobe epilepsy   Temporal epilepsy   Extratemporal epilepsy 5 (50.0) 5 (50.0) Concomitant ASMs   1 Concomitant, %     LEV     VPA     CBZ     LCM     PHB 7 (70.0) 2 2 1 1 1 2 Concomitants, %     LCM     PHB 1 (10.0) 1 1 3 Concomitants, %     ZNS     PHB     LCM     CBZ 2 (20.0) 2 2 1 1 Monthly mean seizure frequency at baseline (n)3.20 ± 5.94* Monthly mean seizure frequency at FU (n)0.56 ± 1.67* Seizure Frequency Rate at FU, n.

The actigraphic recording permitted the monitoring of the sleep–wake cycle for a long period without influencing the activities and the habits of daily living, also in PWE. In particular, it can measure nocturnal sleep and daytime motor activity, other than defining the sleep–wake rhythm. Therefore, the choice of actigraphy other than polysomnography, also preceding MSLT, although unconventional, was done to investigate a different clinical aspect of patients treated by PER. The main finding of the present study was the reduced daytime sleep propensity measured by MSLT, based on the significant increase of the MSL after 6 months of add-on PER treatment in PWE. Moreover, the three patients presenting pathological or nearly pathological MSL at baseline, normalized the MSL at follow-up under adjunctive PER treatment. This improvement can be related to the significant reduction of epileptic seizures, which is also reflected by the achievement of seizure freedom in 9 of 10 patients at follow-up. Moreover, PER had no negative effects on the sleep–wake cycle, since the actigraphic data did not show a significant difference at follow-up. Previous studies demonstrated a positive effect of PER on sleep measured either subjectively or objectively; however, in agreement with our findings, the only study investigating the sleep–wake cycle in PWE treated by PER showed the lack of influence of the drug on the sleep–wake rhythm [13–16].

Accordingly, actig- raphy has been validated to study nocturnal sleep in PWE [33] since represents the best instrument to investigate the rest-activity rhythm in clinical and research contexts due to its economic and ecological characteristics [34]. Recently, actigraphy was used to monitor the 24-h rest-activity rhythm of PWE, and it was evident a sleep–wake pattern dysregu- lation in PWE compared to healthy controls, highlighting not only nocturnal sleep but also daytime activity impair- ment [21]. Moreover, MSLT was used to monitor daytime sleepiness since PER has been associated with daytime som- nolence in PWE as a common side effect [19, 35]. MSLT has been widely demonstrated as a reliable objective test to study daytime sleepiness in PWE, although it was initially developed to assess daytime sleepiness only in hypersomnia syndromes [36]. Specifically, in the past decade, MSLT has been used in several studies evaluating the effects of differ- ent ASM on daytime sleepiness in PWE [37, 38]. Considering the results obtained by actigraphy, no effect of PER on nocturnal sleep and the sleep–wake cycle was evident. This result concords with previous literature show- ing that PER did not affect sleep quality or even improved certain sleep parameters, such as stage 3 of Non-REM sleep or sleep latency [13–16]. Consistently, Rocamora and col- leagues documented an improvement in sleep architecture and subjective sleep quality in patients with focal refractory epilepsy without worsening subjective daytime sleepiness (measured with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale — ESS) after 12 weeks of adjunctive treatment with PER [14]. The novelty of the present study is the objective evalua- tion of daytime sleepiness in PWE treated with PER. Previ- ous studies documented both positive or neutral effects of PER on subjective daytime sleepiness and objective daytime vigilance after PER treatment [13, 15, 16]. In the present study, PWE showed a significant increase in MSL, as a marker of reduced daytime sleep propensity, from base- line to the 6-month follow-up evaluation. The increase of the MSL at follow-up may be in contrast to the daytime sleepiness reported as a side effect in clinical trials [19, 20]. However, real-world studies documented a reduction in the frequency of adverse events due to PER treatment in PWE. This may be explained by the longer titration (from 2 to 4 weeks at 2 mg/day before increasing the daily dosage to 4 mg/day) and the lower dose of PER prescribed when it is used as first or second add-on treatment [11, 12]. Thus, the clinical practice may enable the reduction of adverse events promoting better tolerability of the drug. Another possible explanation for these data is the significant reduction of seizures in patients after starting PER treatment. Further studies should assess the potential beneficial role of seizure freedom on daytime sleepiness and vigilance in PWE treated by PER. Finally, in line with previous studies [7–9, 11, 12, 35], PER improved seizure control in our patients at the 6-month follow-up. In particular, adjunctive PER reduced the number of monthly seizures without significant modifi- cations of the sleep–wake circadian rhythm. Due to the study design, our analysis did not allow establishing the reciprocal relations between seizures, the sleep–wake cycle, and the effect of PER. Nonetheless, it is possible to hypothesize that the beneficial effect of PER on sleep and daytime sleepiness may be not only related to the reduction of seizures but also related to the mechanism of action of the drug. In keeping with the PER pharmacodynamic profile, the effect on the glutamatergic neurotransmission may positively modulate the sleep–wake cycle, as previously reported in patients with RLS or insomnia [18, 39]. The present study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. Firstly, the sample size is small and patients were not compared at baseline to a control group. Secondly, despite the 6-month follow-up that allowed a good estimation of the epileptic seizure control and the effect on sleep–wake rhythm and daytime sleepiness, future studies should consider the evaluation of the PER effects in a longer follow-up. Thirdly, subclinical seizures were not checked considering the absence of EEG recording before MSLT, although patients and their relatives were instructed to complete the seizure diary. Based on this preliminary observation, further studies evaluating the sleep–wake cycle should plan a protocol with polysomnography coupled with MSLT, and actigraphic recording, since it may allow monitoring subclinical seizures by the EEG signals. Fourthly, PER was prescribed as an add-on treatment in all patients according to clinical practice and guidelines, and the concomitant ASMs may also influence the sleep–wake cycle thus reducing the possible beneficial effect of PER. Finally, the presence of depressive or anxiety symptoms was assessed only during the neurological visit, and thus, subclinical psychiatric symptoms were not monitored by questionnaires and scales. Future studies should confirm this preliminary observation and explore the effects of PER on the sleep–wake rhythm and daytime somnolence in a larger group of patients distributing them according to the different concomitant ASMs and assessing depression and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions The findings of the present study suggest that adjunctive PER may improve both the control of seizures and improve daytime sleepiness by reducing daytime sleep propensity without affecting the sleep–wake cycle in PWE. Further studies with a larger sample should be carried out to identify the effects of PER and to increase the knowledge about its 1366 Neurological Sciences (2023) 44:1361–1368 1 3 beneficial role on nocturnal sleep, daytime sleepiness, and the sleep–wake cycle.
