The median inci - dence of epilepsy was 50.4/100,000/year, while it was 45.0 for high -income countries and 81.7 for low- and middle -income countries (2, 3). Prema- ture mortality in epilepsy was 8.8% yet it was 0.7% in normal population (4). Three fourths of the patients have treatable epilep sy and can lead near - normal lives, yet 85% do not receive any treat - ment at all (2). Leviteracetam (LEV) is one of the new antiepilep - tic drugs while carbamazepine (CBZ) is a classical antiepileptic drugs (AED). A meta -analysis co m- paring LEV with other s econd-generation antiepi- leptic drugs had been conducted; however, the comparison was indirect (5). LEV is a broad - spectrum anti-epileptic drug with a safe profile (6, Abstract Leviteracetam (LEV) is a novel antiepileptic drug with improved tolerance and safety, while carbamazepine (CBZ) represents classical antiepileptic drugs. So far, a systemic comparison of the efficacy and side effects of these two drugs is lacking. A literature review on the comparison of leviteracetam versus carbamazepine for patients with epilepsy was performed up to September 2013 using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ISI web of science. Finally, 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) studies met the criteria o n comparing the efficacy of leviteracetam versus carba m- azepine for patients with epilepsy were included for meta -analysis. Stata 11.0 was used to analyze and summarize the respective data. Three RCTs met the entry criteria. The relative risk (RR) and 95% a nd the confidence interval (CI) of leviteracetam versus carbamazepine for 6 - and 12-month seizure free intervals were 1.0 (0.91 -1.10) and 0.97 (0.84 - 1.13), respectively, for therapy discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) were 0.62 (0.48 -0.80) and 1.00 (0.94-2.05), respectively, and for withdrawal after 6- and 12-month treatment were 0.8 (0.64-0.99) and 0.87 (0.74-1.03), respective- ly. The RR and 95% CI for occurrence of headache, fatigue, diarrhea, vertigo, nasopharyngitis, depression, weight gain and rash were 0.88 (0.73-1.06), 1.08(0.63-1.83), 1.23 (0.66-2.28), 0.92 (0.49-1.71), 0.85 (0.59-1.22), 2.15 (1.26-3.68), 0.69 (0.45-1.04), 0.39 (0.23-0.68), respectively. The major outcomes such as rate of seizure freedom were similar between leviteracetam and carbamazepine. However, leviteracetam led to depression more frequently than carbamazepine, while carbamazepine caused rash more frequently. However, the limited numbers of available RCTs studies and i n- cluded patients in this study made our results less convincing and accurate. Keywords: Efficacy, Leviteracetam, Carbamazepine, Epilepsy, Meta-analysis Li et al.: The Efficacy of Leviteracetam versus Carbamazepine … Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir 1617 7). Among the side effects, tiredness (7.8%) and aggressiveness (5%) were the most common ones for of LEV. These were dose -related and the b e- havioral changes and even psychotic reactions were more commonly seen in younger patients (6, 7). CBZ remains one of the most commonly used AEDs worldwide especially in adults. However, in the elderly an d in male patients it is a potent in - ducer of CYP450 system and is subject to auto induction with a considerably narrow therapeutic index (8-11). Dieter Schmidt reported that the introduction of new AEDs have signif icant advantages compared to the old AEDs, particularly due to the absence of severe hypersensitivity reactions and detri - mental drug interactions mediated by enzyme - induction in some new AEDs. However, well - controlled trials of recent -onset epilepsy did not find any evidence that the new AEDs were supe - rior to the old AEDs in efficacy ( 12). French et al. pointed out that in spite of some desirable chara c- teristics of new AEDs, they are much more e x- pensive than standard drugs ( 13). Therefore, it is also important to determine whether the poten tial benefits are worth the additional cost. There have been some debates of the two drugs, which are more suitable for epileptic patients. For this reason, we conducted a meta -analysis of pub- lished randomized controlled trials, comparing the efficacy re presented by total withdrawal rate, the ADR-related withdrawal, the seizure-free rate, and different types of nervous system adverse events including headache, fatigue, diarrhea, vertigo, n a- sopharyngitis, depression, weight gain and rash after using two d rugs of LEV and CBZ on pa - tients with epilepsy. Methods Study characteristics Participants: patients with epilepsy . Interventions: two anti -epileptic drugs . Comparations: compar - ing the efficacy of the two drugs --leviteracetam versus carbamazepine . Outcomes: the outcomes including: total withdrawal rate, the ADR -related withdrawal, the seizure -free rate, and different types of nervous system adverse events, such as headache, fatigue, diarrhea, vertigo, nasopharyngi - tis, depression, weight gain and ras h; the follow - up duration was 12 months. Search strategy We searched all published articles included the two drugs in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the COCHRANE library and ISI web of science (up to September 2013) by using the following keywords: (Epilepsy OR Seizure OR Epileptic Sei- zures) AND (LEV OR Leviteracetam) AND (Car- bamazepine OR CBZ) AND (RCT OR Random - ized Controlled Trials). We also scanned the refer - ence lists of all included studies for additional re f- erences. We contacted the authors of i ncluded studies for additional eligible studies. There was no limitation regarding language and year. Two authors (Chengjuan J and Yayun W) reviewed the titles and abstracts of articles obtained from elec - tronic databases respectively and decided which articles were eligible for full-text review. Inclusion and exclusion criteria We included RCTs that not only contained the therapy of LEV and CBZ, but also were double - blinded or open -label, had been performed in newly diagnosed epileptic patients or patients with partial or generalized epilepsy. We did not restrict the age of the patients. We excluded studies if they explored only one of the two drugs, we also excluded repetitive articles, reviews, case -control studies and cohort studies and studies that were published as abstracts, let - ters, or commentaries. Data extraction and quality assessment To obtain the important information about the included articles for the Meta analysis, we de - signed a standard data abstraction form using ex - cel 2003. Two authors, Chengjuan J and Yayun W (graduate students from Shandong University with a master degree), extracted data independently. When there was a controversy, they would discuss or resort to a librarian until consensus was reached. We extracted information on authors, journal, year of publication, country and region, study type, blindi ng, number of centers, sample size, age of patients, duration of follow -up, num- Iranian J Publ Health, Vol. 43, No.12, Dec 2014, pp. 1616-1626 1618 Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir ber of people with 6 -month and 1 -year seizure free intervals, number of patients discontinued therapy due to adverse reactions, and number of patients with different adverse re actions. We ex - tracted data on ITT (intention to treat) population or PP (per protocol) population properly. To assess the study quality, we used the five -point scale developed by Jadad et al. (14). They were assessed based on the following 3 aspects: ra n- domization (0 -2 points), double blinding (0 -2 points) and withdrawals and dropouts (0 -1 point). Scores ≤2 points indicated inferior quality of the study whereas scores ≥3 points supported the study with high quality. The final summarized data was performe d by us - ing Stata 11.0. Outcome measures In this meta -analysis, we measured the total with - drawal rate, the ADR -related withdrawal, the sei - zure-free rate, and different types of nervous sys - tem adverse events. Zaccara reported that the classification of nervous system adverse events was divided into the following 5 broad classes: those affecting vigilance, those affecting the vesti - bule-cerebellar system, those affecting the motor system (including Chorea Parkinsonism, tremor), cognitive impairment, and psychiatric and psycho- logical adverse effects (including anxiety, depres - sion, dissociation, hallucination, cognitive impair - ment and behavioral disturbances) (15) . There were still several uncertainties that needed clarif i- cation regarding psychological and psychiat ric AEs. First, the subjective measures could not be quantified. Second, different patients had different thresholds for the adverse effects. Third, patients were susceptible to the covert influence from i n- vestigators. Therefore, the analytical re sults of the psychological and psychiatric AEs might deviate from the actual outcomes. Analysis We extracted the number of patients that had re - ceived LEV and CBZ therapies separately and the number of patients who had our desired observed measurements from each study. We used Stata version 11.0 to perform the meta - analysis. The “metan” command in Stata was used to pool the OR across studies and generate a vis - ual forest plot for inspection. We measured hete r- ogeneity in results across studies using the Cochran Q (significance <0.05) and I2 statistic (16, 17). Our results indicated these studies were not homogeneous. When substantial heterogeneity was detected, the summary estimate was then ca l- culated according to DerSimonian and Laird ra n- dom-effects model (18). Otherwise, pooled est i- mates were based on the fixed effects model. Sensitivity analysis was perfor med to assess the effects of selected study quality and clinical factors on the pooled outcome. Egger’s test and Begg’s test were used to assess the possibility of publication bias, and a funnel plot was usually applied for visual inspection (19, 20). We c onsidered the publication bias statisti - cally significant when the P<0.05 for Egger’s or Begg’s tests. When it contained no less than 10 included studies, publication bias could be evalu - ated through Egger’s test and Begg’s test. Meta-regression is a metho d to assess the source of heterogeneity; however, it could not be evalu - ated with less than 10 included studies (21). In other words, as the number of included studies was small, it would produce bias when using m e- ta-regression for analyzing the source of heteroge- neity. Therefore, in this study we did not analyze the source of heterogeneity. Results Search results The initial search identified 174 articles. After e x- amining the titles and abstracts, only 35 articles were retained for full review. Thirty-five studies met our criteria for detailed analysis. Figure 1 shows the flow diagram for identifying the articles that were included in our final analysis. The 3 studies that met the inclusion criteria are summa - rized in Table 1. A total of 1696 ep ileptic patients were in the included studies. Li et al.: The Efficacy of Leviteracetam versus Carbamazepine … Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir 1619 Fig. 1: Flow diagram of the literature search and trial selection process Study characteristics and quality assessment Four studies were potentially suitable for this analysis. Only 3 studies are finally included, as we were not able to obtain detailed information r e- garding the fourth study (22) . Characteristics of the 3 selected studies are presented in Table 1. All 3 studies were published from 2007 to 2013 and they were all RCTs. One study was conducted in Italy (2 3), one in European countries and Aus - tralia (24), and one in European countries and South Africa (25). The follow -up duration was 12 months. All included patients were adults. The sample sizes of these studies ranged from 128 to 996. The eligible patients for two studies were pa - tients with newly diagnosed epilepsy (23, 24), and one patient with late post-stroke seizures (23).

Consoli et al. summarized the number and percentage of abnormal EEGs, neuropsychologi - cal findings and number of patients with recur - rence of seizures (23). Trinka et al. reported the quality of life, time to first seizure for focal sei - zures and generalized seizures, treatment with - drawal rate and seizure freedom rate of focal sei - zures and generalized seizures inde pendently and separately recorded the number of patients with drug-related AEs, severe AEs, and serious AEs (24). The quality of the RCTs was assessed according to the Jadad scale for quality. Outcome of quality assessment of RCTs are shown in Table 2. Onl y one study scored five points (25), the others scored 3 (23, 24). The scores implied that articles included in this meta-analysis were of high quality. As in the report, we included three eligible studies. The number of included studies was too small to perform analysis of bias of each study. If we ana- lyze the risk of bias of each study, the results were unstable and believable. Iranian J Publ Health, Vol. 43, No.12, Dec 2014, pp. 1616-1626 1620 Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir Outcomes 1. Estimates of patients with seizure -freedom (Fig. 2) Information on seizure-free intervals for 6 months information was available for 1696 patients in all 3 trials. The common estimated risk ratio ( RR) was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.91 -1.10), favoring neither LEV nor CBZ, and was not statistically significant (P=0.995). Meanwhile there was evidence of moderate heterogeneity betw een trials ( I2=52.4%, P=0.122). Three studies including 1696 participants, re - ported seizure -freedom for 12 months. The pooled estimated risk ratio ( RR) was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.84-1.13), also favoring LEV but without st a- tistical significance ( P=0.725). However quantita - tive heterogeneity was observed between trials (I2=73.8%, P=0.022).

As for treatment withdrawal for 12 months, all three trials were included. The estimates of pooled RR was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.74 -1.03), favoring LEV; however, without statistical significance ( P=0.110). No sign of heterogeneity between studies was found (I2=0.0%, P=0.992). The outcome with patients with at least one AEs, estimates of pooled RR was 1.00 (95%CI: 0.94 - 1.05), favoring neither LEV nor CBZ, and the re - sults were not statistically significant ( P=0.889). No evidence of heterogeneity between studies was observed (I2=0.0%, P=0.992). LEV appeared to be associated with a lower rate of treatment withdrawal for 6 months compared to CBZ (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64 -0.99). As for treatment withdrawal for 12 months and risk for patients with at least one AE, no significant differ- ence was detected.

The po s- sible reasons are as follows: Firstly, we had strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to guarantee the quality of thi s report. Secondly, LEV is a novel anti-epileptic drug, and there are few studies co m- paring LEV and CBZ. Thirdly, the number of RCT is small; the number of included RCT is smaller. We have searched all possible studies to find only 3 eligible RCT for our report. Based on pooled estimates from this meta-analysis, we concluded that LEV had significant advantages in patients who had discontinued therapy due to AEs and treatment withdrawal for 6 -month com- pared to CBZ. LEV appeared to be more effective for 12 -month seizure freedom and lead to lower treatment withdrawal for 12 -month compared to CBZ. However, no statistically significant differ - ence was found. Regarding seizure freedom for 6 - month and the number and rate of patients with at least one AE, there was no difference observed between LEV and CBZ. LEV and CBZ brought about almost similar rates of seizure freedom for 6-month or 12 -month, i.e., there was no major difference between the 2 drugs regarding the main outcomes. This was consistent with several studies (22, 24-26). Moreover, when the participants were adults with post -stroke partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, LEV and CBZ were still equally efficac ious (23). When it comes to treat - ment withdrawal for 6 -month, LEV is slightly s u- perior to CBZ. The pooled estimates of this analy- sis favored LEV as it could decrease the num ber of participants who discontinued therapy due to AEs and treatment withdrawal. The adverse events were difficult to compare be - tween studies because of several factors such as lack of standardized descriptions of adverse events, objective quantifiable measures and sever - . . . . 5.1 Nasopharyngitis M.J.

In this meta - analysis, we selected 8 kinds of AEs to compare the differences between LEV and CBZ. Wieshmann thought that LEV had a different side effect profile than older AEDs. In the study, the AEs were reported by patients themselves. Mor e- over, the observation s hould be further tested by randomized studies (28). ADs of antiepi leptic drugs involved changes in hematology and che m- istry, hypersensitivity, infection, behavioral sym p- toms, changes in cognition, accidents and deaths, changes in sleep patterns, weight ch ange, and so on. LEV was considered to have signifi cant a d- vantages over CBZ regarding cognitive func tions (23,26,29). One study researched cur rent antiep i- leptic drugs on quality of life (QOL) of epileptic patients to conclude that patients treated with LEV obtained higher QOL scores than pa tients treated wit h CBZ (30). Another study con ducted in Korea showed that patients with drug - refractory epilepsy demonstrated that LEV intake resulted in significant improvement in QOL( 31). Bachmann et al. discovered that patients treated with LE V monotherapy had lower platelet counts than patients on CBZ monotherapy, with no di f- ference in Hb or WBC (32). Further studies should focus on the mechanism by which LEV might affect thrombocyte count or function. In 2003, a review analyzing randomized, controlled clinical trials showed that LEV appeared to be a weight neutral AED ( 33). Recently, through a re t- rospective observational study, Pickrell et al. pointed out that LEV wa s associated with signifi - cant weight gain, and CBZ was not associated with significant weight changes (34). There is great debate on weight change. We did not find strong evidence that CBZ was more likely to induce AEs such as headaches, fa - tigue, diarrhea, vertigo, nasopharyngitis and weight gain than LEV. However, LEV was associ- ated with a higher rate of depression, while CBZ appeared to cause a higher rate of rash. In this meta -analysis, we included as many differ - ent AEs as possible to obtain as much detail on adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs as possible. In fact, different studies contained varied AEs making it difficult to collect the data we needed . We finally selected 8 types of ADs to be included in this meta -analysis. The pooled estimates indi - cated that LEV was more inclined to result in d e- pression while CBZ could cause rash more fre - quently. Currently, a lot of controversy exists on the relati onship between depression and antiep i- leptic drugs. On the one hand, depression is one of the considerable reasons that require with - drawal of LEV (28, 35, 36). On the other hand, LEV intake has been shown to improve de - pression (31). CBZ was always considered effec - tive in depression, with great improvements in major depressive disorders (37-39). Analysis of the included three RCTs demonstrated that the effect of CBZ on depression was more satisfying than that of LEV, which corresponded to the studies above. To clarify the existing controversy regard - ing depression due to LEV, a large RCT is still needed. The results of this study on rash were in agreement with the study by H. Arif that showed that rash rates were higher with CBZ than LEV (40). This could be explained by the theory that LEV can decrease the incidence of hypersensitiv - ity. In addition, LEV seemed to be the better choice when patients were anxious regarding headache, vertigo, nasopharyngitis, and weight gain. However, no evidence with statistical signifi - cance was found. CBZ could probably be recom - mended when patients worry about fatigue and diarrhea, even though there is no data with to sup- port this. Conclusion The major outcomes such as rate of seizure free - dom were similar between LEV and CBZ. How - ever, LEV led to depression more frequently than CBZ, while CBZ caused rash more frequently. LEV seemed to be the better choice when pa - tients were anxious regarding headache, vertigo, nasopharyngitis, and weight gain. CBZ could probably be recommended when pa tients worry about fatigue and diarrhea. The deficiencies of this analysis are as follows: Li et al.: The Efficacy of Leviteracetam versus Carbamazepine … Available at: http://ijph.tums.ac.ir 1625 1. The number of included RCTs studies and patients are inadequate, which makes the re - sults less convincing and accurate. 2. Lack of uniform criteria and quantita tive evaluation for adverse events of antiepileptic drugs makes it difficult to collect data on ADs and to conclude accurate results. Therefore, a quantitative criterion for the selection of ADs in epileptic patients is needed.

# Comprehensive Summary of the Study on Levetiracetam and Carbamazepine in Epilepsy Treatment\n\n## Context and Importance of Study\n### Global Impact of Epilepsy\n- Epilepsy is a significant global health issue, affecting approximately 70 million people worldwide. The condition is particularly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, where many patients do not receive adequate treatment despite the availability of various therapeutic options.\n\n## Drugs Compared\n### Levetiracetam (LEV) vs. Carbamazepine (CBZ)\n- The study focuses on comparing two antiepileptic drugs: Levetiracetam (LEV), a newer medication known for its safety and tolerability, and Carbamazepine (CBZ), a traditional antiepileptic drug.\n\n## Research Objective\n### Aim of the Study\n- The primary objective was to conduct a meta-analysis to systematically assess and compare the efficacy and side effects of LEV and CBZ in the treatment of epilepsy.\n\n## Methodology\n### Study Selection\n- The meta-analysis included three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met specific criteria. Data analysis was performed using Stata 11.0 software.\n\n## Key Findings\n### Seizure Freedom Rates\n- The study revealed that LEV and CBZ had comparable rates of seizure freedom.\n### Side Effects\n- LEV was associated with a higher incidence of depression, while CBZ was linked to more frequent rashes. The rates of adverse events leading to therapy discontinuation were 0.62 for LEV and 1.00 for CBZ.\n\n## Limitations\n### Study Constraints\n- The findings may be limited by the small number of RCTs and the small sample sizes of the included studies, which could affect the reliability and generalizability of the results.\n\n## Conclusion\n### Efficacy and Side Effects\n- Both LEV and CBZ showed similar efficacy in controlling seizures, but their differing side effect profiles may influence treatment choices. Further research is needed to draw more definitive conclusions.\n\n## Keywords\n- Efficacy, Levetiracetam, Carbamazepine, Epilepsy, Meta-analysis.\n\n## Detailed Study Insights\n\n### Study Objective\n- The study aimed to compare the efficacy of LEV and CBZ in treating epilepsy, focusing on outcomes such as withdrawal rates, seizure-free rates, and adverse events.\n\n### Outcomes Measured\n- Key metrics included total withdrawal rates, adverse drug reaction (ADR)-related withdrawals, seizure-free rates, and various nervous system adverse events, such as headache, fatigue, and depression.\n\n### Search Strategy\n- A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE, ISI Web of Science) for relevant articles published until September 2013, using specific keywords related to epilepsy and the two drugs.\n\n### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n- Included studies were RCTs involving both LEV and CBZ, focusing on newly diagnosed epilepsy patients. Studies examining only one drug, repetitive articles, reviews, and non-RCTs were excluded.\n\n### Data Extraction and Quality Assessment\n- Data was extracted using a standardized form, and study quality was evaluated using a five-point scale based on randomization, blinding, and dropout rates.\n\n### Outcome Measures\n- The meta-analysis focused on withdrawal rates, ADR-related withdrawals, seizure-free rates, and various nervous system adverse events, noting challenges in quantifying psychological and psychiatric adverse effects.\n\n### Analysis Methodology\n- Statistical analysis utilized Stata software, employing both fixed and random-effects models based on study heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessments were also performed.\n\n### Search Results\n- The initial search yielded 174 articles, with 35 deemed eligible for full review, ultimately leading to the inclusion of 3 studies involving 1696 epileptic patients.\n\n### Study Characteristics\n- The included studies were published between 2007 and 2013, with follow-up durations of 12 months, involving adult patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy or late post-stroke seizures.\n\n### Quality Assessment\n- The quality of the RCTs was assessed using the Jadad scale, with scores indicating high quality (one study scored 5 points, and the others scored 3).\n\n### Outcomes\n- For 6-month seizure-free intervals, the risk ratio (RR) was 1.00, indicating no significant difference between LEV and CBZ. For 12 months, the RR was 0.97, also not statistically significant.\n- The pooled RR for patients discontinuing therapy due to AEs favored LEV (RR = 0.62), which was statistically significant.\n\n### Heterogeneity\n- Moderate to high heterogeneity was observed in studies regarding seizure freedom rates, indicating variability in outcomes.\n\n### Data Presentation\n- The text includes figures and tables summarizing the flow of article selection, study characteristics, and quality assessment outcomes.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Publication Bias Evaluation\n- Publication bias was evaluated using Egger\u2019s test and Begg\u2019s test, but meta-regression could not be performed due to the small number of included studies.\n\n### Adverse Events Analysis\n- The analysis found no significant differences in the frequency of headaches, fatigue, diarrhea, and vertigo between LEV and CBZ, with pooled RR estimates indicating similar outcomes.\n\n### Quality of Life\n- Patients treated with LEV reported higher quality of life scores compared to those on CBZ, particularly in cases of drug-refractory epilepsy.\n\n### Limitations of the Analysis\n- The analysis faced limitations due to a small number of included studies and a lack of uniform criteria for evaluating AEs, emphasizing the need for standardized criteria in future research.\n\n### Ethical Considerations\n- The authors declared adherence to ethical standards, including issues related to consent and data integrity.\n\n### Acknowledgment\n- The study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, and the authors reported no conflicts of interest.\n\n## Conclusion\n### Final Thoughts\n- While LEV may offer advantages over CBZ, particularly in terms of treatment withdrawal due to AEs, the overall efficacy in seizure control appears similar between the two drugs. Further randomized studies are recommended to confirm these findings.\n\n# Overview of Antiepileptic Drug Studies\n\nThe text discusses various studies that explore the effects and outcomes of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in different contexts, including their impact on weight, efficacy in refractory epilepsy, and their use in mood disorders.\n\n## Weight Change and Antiepileptic Drugs\n- **Rees MI (2013)**: This study addresses the weight changes that may occur as a result of using antiepileptic medications, highlighting the importance of monitoring weight in patients undergoing treatment.\n\n## Efficacy of Levetiracetam\n### Levetiracetam in Refractory Epilepsy\n- **Mohanraj et al. (2005)**: Conducted a prospective observational study focusing on the effectiveness of levetiracetam in patients who have refractory epilepsy, providing insights into its role in managing difficult-to-treat cases.\n\n### Levetiracetam Monotherapy Outcomes\n- **Stephen et al. (2011)**: Reported on the outcomes of patients receiving levetiracetam as a monotherapy in an epilepsy clinic, contributing to the understanding of its efficacy as a standalone treatment.\n\n## Carbamazepine in Mood Disorders\n### Carbamazepine in Bipolar Disorder\n- **Weisler et al. (2006)**: Presented pooled results from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the use of extended-release carbamazepine capsules as a monotherapy for bipolar disorder, indicating its potential effectiveness in mood stabilization.\n\n### Herbal Medicine with Carbamazepine\n- **Zhang et al. (2007)**: Conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to assess the adjunctive use of herbal medicine alongside carbamazepine for treating bipolar disorders, exploring alternative treatment options.\n\n### Carbamazepine in Unipolar Depression\n- **Zhang et al. (2008)**: Evaluated the effectiveness of carbamazepine in treating unipolar depression through a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, further expanding its therapeutic applications.\n\n## Rash Associated with Antiepileptic Drugs\n- **Arif et al. (2007)**: This study compares and identifies predictors of rash associated with 15 different antiepileptic drugs, providing valuable information for clinicians regarding the side effects of AEDs.\n\n## Copyright Notice\n- The text includes a copyright notice from the Iranian Journal of Public Health, indicating ownership of the content and outlining restrictions on copying or distributing the material without permission, while allowing for individual use.
